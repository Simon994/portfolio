    "I'm a software engineer with a background in product management and scientific publishing.",
    "My first taste of programming was during my DPhil (PhD) at the University of Oxford. There, I designed and programmed instruments that helped to uncover the chemistry and physics of bird navigation. I also developed a passion for publishing my results, which led me to become the editor for a portfolio of scientific journals. As an editor, I collaborated with software engineers, data scientists and UX designers to develop journal products that our readers and authors loved.",
    "The technology-driven change I experienced in the scientific publishing industry inspired me to return to programming. Now completing the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly, Iâ€™m looking to apply my skills for problem solving and analysis in an environment that encourages learning and creative, curious thinking."
